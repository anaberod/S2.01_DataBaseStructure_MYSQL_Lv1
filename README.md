# 📘 SQL Database Modeling – Level 1

## 📄 Description – Exercise Statement

This project consists of modeling and creating SQL databases based on the requirements of two business cases: an optician's shop and a pizzeria. Each exercise involves designing the entity-relationship model and implementing the SQL structure and data.

The main objective is to learn how to properly model SQL relational databases.
